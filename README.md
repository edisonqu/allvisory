Hack the 6ix: Wealthsimple Foundations Challenge

Many people believe that they need to be wealthy and rich in order to invest and have some form of financial literacy.  Financial Advisors can help with your personal finances however, some may not be able to afford one because of how much they cost. The name "allvisor" is Financial Advisors for all, no matter their ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status. Providing this service for free for people who earn less than  200,000 a year helps people who are hesitant and stigmatized by the "investing is only for the rich" to try out investing and saving to better help their financial goals and plans. We felt that some of the Robo-advisors online were not personalized enough and that many people would not trust the robots, so we also incorporated real-life financial advisors as well.
